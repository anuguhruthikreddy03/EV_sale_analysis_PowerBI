🚀 Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analytics Dashboard
📊 Power BI Interactive Dashboard

This project presents an in-depth analysis of global Electric Vehicle (EV) data trends using Power BI. The dashboard focuses on identifying growth patterns, regional distribution, mode-wise performance, and powertrain adoption across various metrics.

📁 Project Overview

The dashboard provides a multi-level analytical breakdown through five major sections:

🔹 1. Trend Analysis

Objective: Examine overall EV adoption trends and key performance indicators over time.

Insights Covered:

Sum of EV-related values by year

Comparison across categories (Historical, APS, STEPS projections)

Unit-based sales tracking (charging points, GWh, oil displacement, vehicles, etc.)

Outcome: Identifies strong upward growth post-2020 with accelerated EV adoption projected toward 2040.

🔹 2. Regional / Country Analysis

Objective: Understand regional EV market dynamics and stock/sales share performance.

Insights Covered:

Average EV value and sales by region

EV stock and sales comparison among countries (China, USA, Europe leading)

Regional time-series growth (2010–2040)

Outcome: China dominates the EV market, followed by the USA and Europe. Significant growth forecasted globally beyond 2030.

🔹 3. Mode Analysis

Objective: Analyze the EV market distribution across different modes of transport.

Insights Covered:

EV stock by mode (Cars, Vans, Buses, Trucks)

Powertrain contribution by vehicle mode

Year-wise comparison between Buses and Cars

Outcome:

Cars contribute the majority of EV stock (~87%)

Buses show strong EV stock share growth due to public transport electrification.

🔹 4. Powertrain Analysis

Objective: Explore EV adoption by powertrain types and regional patterns.

Insights Covered:

Comparison of BEV, PHEV, FCEV, and hybrid models

Growth trends from 2010 to 2040

Regional dominance by powertrain type

Outcome:

Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) lead globally with 75%+ market share.

PHEVs show consistent but moderate growth compared to BEVs.

🔹 5. Parameter vs Unit Analysis

Objective: Evaluate relationships between different EV parameters and their respective units.

Insights Covered:

Sum of EV sales, stock, charging points, and energy demand by unit

Cross-region parameter comparison (EV sales, charging, oil displacement, etc.)

Count of key parameters by unit type (Vehicles, percent, GWh, etc.)

Outcome:

Vehicles remain the primary measurement unit.

EV stock is the highest-value parameter, followed by EV sales and charging points.

📈 Key Findings

✅ Rapid EV growth expected post-2020 with steep upward trend through 2040.
✅ China, USA, and Europe dominate EV adoption and production.
✅ BEVs lead in global market share with strong policy support.
✅ Cars account for nearly 87% of total EV stock value.
✅ Buses and Vans show accelerating electrification rates in public and commercial transport.
